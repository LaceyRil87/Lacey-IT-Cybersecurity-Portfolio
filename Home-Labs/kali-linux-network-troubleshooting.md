# Kali Linux Network Troubleshooting Lab

## Overview
This lab focused on configuring and troubleshooting network connectivity within a Kali Linux virtual machine.

## Objective
The goal of this lab was to ensure proper network configuration and connectivity between virtual machines in a controlled lab environment.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- Virtual machine software
- Terminal
- Network configuration files

## Issues Encountered
Initially, the virtual machine did not have proper network connectivity. IP addresses were not assigning as expected, and communication between machines was inconsistent.

## Troubleshooting Process
I reviewed the network configuration file and verified interface settings. I restarted networking services, checked IP address assignments, and tested connectivity using command line tools.

## Resolution
After correcting the network interface configuration and restarting the networking service, the system successfully obtained an IP address and network connectivity was restored.

## What I Learned
This lab reinforced the importance of understanding network interface configuration and methodical troubleshooting when resolving connectivity issues in Linux environments.
